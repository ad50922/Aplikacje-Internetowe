      Global warming, a significant aspect of climate change, refers to the long-term increase
      in Earth's average surface temperature. Predominantly a result of human activities, this rise in
      temperature poses severe threats to ecosystems, human health, and economies worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Climate change, particularly global warming, is the gradual elevation of Earth's surface
      temperature over time. Largely driven by human-induced factors, this climatic shift jeopardizes
      natural habitats, endangers human well-being, and has profound implications for global economic
      stability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phenomenon of global warming, an alarming facet of climate change, denotes the consistent
      rise in Earth's mean surface temperature. Largely attributable to human actions, this warming
      trend has far-reaching consequences for biodiversity, human safety, and the world's economic
      structures.
